# "Kloster von Code-Schmelz" (Monastery of Code Smells) â›ª

The monastery, Kloster von Code-Schmelz, is nestled in the Lower-Bavaria, where monks have been creating fine beer, cheese, and herbal remedies for centuries. To keep track of their brewing, cheese-making, and herb-collecting processes, the monks coded a software program. However, over the years, the code became tangled with code smells as each new monk added their own special twist without cleaning it up. The program is barely holding together, and the monks need your help to refactor the code!

## Task Description
1. Identify (at least) 10 different code smells within the provided code!
2. Refactor the code to enable the monks to use their software for the next 500 years!
