/*
1. Code Smells and SOLID Principle Violations
Bad Naming: Classes like Manage, Control, and DoWork are vague and don't clarify their purpose. nam, m_value, and m_data are unclear and non-descriptive.

2. SRP Violation:
- Control class handles both time printing and status handling.
- Worker class both performs calculations and prints data.

3. OCP Violation: printTime function is not open for extension, so adding new time formats would require modifying this function directly.

4. Liskov Substitution Principle: This example does not have inheritance, but if Manage were a base class with specific fields, changes could lead to issues here as well.

5. ISP Violation: The DoWork class should not be required to know about the Worker class directly; rather, it could depend on a generic interface.

6. DIP Violation: DoWork directly depends on Worker, rather than an abstraction or interface, making it less flexible.

7. Comments: Some comments state the obvious, like "Print the status" or "Increment m_value by the input," which don't add value and clutter the code.
